### 1.1 Web Interactive Mechanisms
This work uses web as the primary medium, enhancing story experience through multi-layered interactive mechanisms:

1. **Branch Selection System**
   - Implementation of multiple branching story structures, including:
     - 1 main ending (mainEnding)
     - 7 bad endings (badEnding1-7)
     - 1 epilogue
   - Each key node provides 2-3 choices
   - Design of non-linear narrative experience

2. **Visual Feedback System**
   - Real-time progress bar updates
   - Dynamic scene image transitions
   - Interactive button effects
   - Special scene warnings (e.g., bad endings)

3. **State Tracking System**
   - Records player choice paths
   - Provides return mechanism
   - Supports restart functionality

### 1.2 Visual Narrative Elements
- Adoption of cyberpunk style scene design
- Use of gradient color scheme:
  - Primary color: #00f2ff (cyan)
  - Secondary color: #ff00ff (magenta)
  - Background: #0a0a1a (deep blue)
  - Accent: #ff3366 (red)
- Special visual effects:
  - Text glow effects
  - Button hover animations
  - Scene transition gradients

## Conclusion
This work realizes a deep interactive narrative experience through web technology, merging three story worlds ("Consciousness Rift-2048", "Guardian Lila", and "The Key of Destiny") into a transmedia work with multiple possibilities. Through carefully designed interactive mechanisms and visual effects, it not only maintains the thematic depth of the original works but also provides readers with opportunities to actively participate in story development. The story combines elements of technology, magic, and adventure, creating a unique and rich narrative experience.
